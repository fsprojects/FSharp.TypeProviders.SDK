# F# Type Provider Starter Pack [![NuGet Status](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/FSharp.TypeProviders.StarterPack.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.TypeProviders.StarterPack/)

The F# Type Provider Starter Pack is two things: 

1. The ``ProvidedTypes.fs`` API files you need to author type providers

2. Documentation and samples on type provider creation

This package is actively seeking contributions.   We are aiming for documentation
(the plan is a GitHub page setup similar to [FSharp.Data](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data)) with
examples of all the most common features of Type Providers that people will want to use (basic erased type
generation, parameterized providers, full generated types, seperating design and runtime how's and why's, etc). 
It will also become the main place for improvements and additions to the ProvidedTypes code.

## The ProvidedTypes API - Adding the Files

Building a type provider nearly always starts with adding these files to your project:

* ProvidedTypes.fsi
* ProvidedTypes.fs

The [Starter Pack NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.TypeProviders.StarterPack) contains both these files as well as a set of debugging helpers, and when you install
it, it should add them all to your F# project. It's probably best not to modify the files after adding them as
upgrades to the package will ask to replace the previous versions - either submit changes back to this project
or shadow the relevant functions in a seperate file.

If using Paket, you can also add code files by direct GitHub references.


## The ProvidedTypes API - Cross-Targeting Type Providers

Type providers may be used in projects that generate portable code or target other .NET Frameworks than
that being used by the F# compiler. To convert an erasing
type provider to a cross-targeting erasing type provider, add the following source files to your project:

* AssemblyReader.fs
* AssemblyReaderReflection.fs
* ProvidedTypesContext.fs

Then add 

```fsharp
let ctxt = ProvidedTypesContext.Create(config)
```

to your code and always create provided entities using this ``ctxt`` object:

```fsharp
let myType = ctxt.ProvidedTypeDefinition(asm, ns, "MyType", Some typeof<obj>)
```

This is shown in the example below.

## The ProvidedTypes API - A Basic Type Provider

Here is a basic erasing type provider using the Provided Types API:

```fsharp
open ProviderImplementation
open ProviderImplementation.ProvidedTypes
open Microsoft.FSharp.Core.CompilerServices
open System.Reflection

[<TypeProvider>]
type BasicProvider (config : TypeProviderConfig) as this =
    inherit TypeProviderForNamespaces ()

    let ns = "StaticProperty.Provided"
    let asm = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()
    let ctxt = ProvidedTypesContext.Create(config)

    let createTypes () =
        let myType = ctxt.ProvidedTypeDefinition(asm, ns, "MyType", Some typeof<obj>)
        let myProp = ctxt.ProvidedProperty("MyProperty", typeof<string>, IsStatic = true, getterCode = (fun args -> <@@ "Hello world" @@>))
        myType.AddMember(myProp)
        [myType]

    do
        this.AddNamespace(ns, createTypes())

[<assembly:TypeProviderAssembly>]
do ()
```
