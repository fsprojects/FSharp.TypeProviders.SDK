* ProvidedTypesContext now internal to ``TypeProviderForNamespaces``.  You can access it using ``this.TargetContext`` in the ``TypeProviderForNamespaces`` object
* Calls such as ``ctxt.ProvidedTypeDefinition(...)`` become just ``ProvidedTypeDefinition`` once again
* ``ProvidedLiteralField`` --> ``ProvidedField.Literal``
* Bug fixes to context translation based on further testing
* ``ProvidedTypesContext.MakeGenericType`` --> ``ProvidedTypeBuilder.MakeGenericType``
* ``ProvidedTypesContext.MakeGenericMethod`` --> ``ProvidedTypeBuilder.MakeGenericMethod``
* More internal consistency checking of translation, better diagnostics
* Some getters removed from public API.
* ``IsImplicitCtor`` --> ``IsImplicitConstructor``
* ``ProvidedTypeDefinition.Logger`` removed
* ``TryBindAssembly*`` --> ``TryBindTargetAssembly*``
* ``RegisterGenerated`` --> ``RegisterGeneratedTargetAssembly``
* ``tp.TargetContext`` added to access the target context of referenced assemblies


#### 3.0.1 - October 1 2017
* Cross-targeting for generative type providers, and reimplement binary reader 

#### 3.0.0 - October 9 2017
* All type providers now use a ProvidedTypesContext, e.g.
     let ctxt = ProvidedTypesContext.Create(config)
     ...
     let myType = ctxt.ProvidedTypeDefinition(asm, ns, "MyType", Some typeof<obj>)
    ...
  There are no more direct constructors for ProvidedTypeDefinition etc.

* ProvidedTypesContext.Create now takes a flag isForGenerated. It should be set to true for generative type providers

* ``IsStaticMethod=true`` becomes ``isStatic=true`` and some other similar naming changes

* Direct setters such as prop.GetterCode <- ... are removed in favour of optional parameters ``getterCode=...``. You must specify getterCode as a parameter

* Enables use as part of .NET Core execution of the F# compiler by extending TypeDelegator instead of Type. This needs to be more fully tested but repo itself now compiles as both .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework, and passes tests as both .NET CoreApp 2.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.1

* Puts everything into one file ProvidedTypes.fs and ProvidedTypes.fsi. This file is large but this approach makes it very easy for people writing existing type providers to update (after accounting for changes in the ProvidedTypes API)
